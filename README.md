This repository contains the implementation of "Golden Ratio Yoshimura" for meta-stable and massively reconfigurable deployment, as submitted to Philosophical Transactions A under Manuscript ID RSTA-2024-0009. The paper presents a novel approach to Yoshimura folding, utilizing the Golden Ratio angle to define triangular facets, resulting in a structure capable of meta-stable and massively reconfigurable deployment. The research spans mechanical engineering, structural engineering, and origami, exploring applications in space exploration, kinetic architectures, soft robotics, and everyday household items.

## Repository Structure

- `/data`
    - `/media`: Contains images related to the Golden Ratio Yoshimura structure.
